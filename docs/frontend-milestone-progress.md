## Important Information

### Environment Variables

The frontend requires the following environment variables:

- `VITE_API_URL`: URL for the backend API (default: http://localhost:8080/api)
- `VITE_WS_URL`: URL for the WebSocket server (default: http://localhost:8080)

These should be defined in a `.env` file in the frontend directory.

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are used by the implemented features:

#### Projects
- `GET /api/projects`: Get all projects
- `GET /api/projects/:id`: Get a specific project
- `POST /api/projects`: Create a new project
- `PUT /api/projects/:id`: Update a project
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id`: Delete a project
- `GET /api/projects/:id/agents`: Get agents associated with a project
- `GET /api/projects/:id/tasks`: Get tasks within a project

#### Chat
- `POST /chat/message`: Send a chat message
- `GET /chat/sessions/:session_id`: Get chat history for a session
- `POST /chat/sessions`: Create a new chat session
- `GET /chat/sessions`: Get all chat sessions for the current user

### WebSocket Events

The following WebSocket events are handled by the implemented features:

#### Projects
- `project.created`: A new project has been created
- `project.updated`: A project has been updated
- `project.deleted`: A project has been deleted
- `project.agent_added`: An agent has been added to a project
- `project.agent_removed`: An agent has been removed from a project
- `project.task_added`: A task has been added to a project
- `project.task_removed`: A task has been removed from a project

#### Chat
- `chat.message_received`: A new chat message has been received
- `chat.typing_started`: The bot has started typing
- `chat.typing_stopped`: The bot has stopped typing
- `chat.message_read`: A message has been read

## Challenges and Solutions

### React 19 Compatibility

The project uses React 19, which caused compatibility issues with some third-party libraries:

- **Challenge**: Both NLUX and Chat UI Kit React libraries had peer dependencies requiring React 18 or lower.
- **Solution**: Implemented a custom chat interface without using third-party libraries, which provides more control over the UI and avoids compatibility issues.

### WebSocket Event Handling

- **Challenge**: Ensuring that WebSocket events update the Redux store correctly.
- **Solution**: Created dedicated event handlers for each event type and dispatched appropriate Redux actions.

## Testing

To test the implemented features:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Projects page to test the projects list and detail views.
3. Use the chat interface by clicking the chat button in the bottom right corner.
4. Test real-time updates by making changes in another browser window or through the API.
