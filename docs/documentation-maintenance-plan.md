## Cleanup Priorities

### Immediate Cleanup Tasks

1. **Service Startup Troubleshooting Reorganization**
   - **Target file**: `docs/developer-guides/service-development/service-startup-troubleshooting.md`
   - **Actions**:
     - Create distinct sections for each service
     - Add a "Last Updated" timestamp at the top
     - Add a "Current Status" section showing which services are functional vs still having issues
     - Implement a standardized problem/solution format for each issue
     - Add a table of contents for quick navigation
     - Create cross-references to `troubleshooting-guide.md` where appropriate

2. **General Troubleshooting Guide Enhancement**
   - **Target file**: `docs/developer-guides/service-development/troubleshooting-guide.md`
   - **Actions**:
     - Create category-based sections (Database, Import, Model, API, etc.)
     - Add clear distinction between this general guide and the service-specific startup guide
     - Implement a standardized problem/solution format
     - Remove any resolved issues that are now historical and better suited for model-standardization-history.md
     - Create an index of common error messages and their locations in the guide

3. **Agent Orchestrator Migration Document Consolidation**
   - **Target files**: 
     - `docs/developer-guides/service-development/agent-orchestrator-migration-implementation.md`
     - `docs/developer-guides/service-development/agent-orchestrator-migration-implementation-completed.md`
   - **Actions**:
     - Merge all relevant content into the "completed" document
     - Add a clear "COMPLETED" status marker at the top
     - Remove the incomplete document once content is merged
     - Update any links in other documents to point to the completed version

4. **README.md Refresh**
   - **Target file**: `docs/README.md`
   - **Actions**:
     - Update "Recent Troubleshooting" section with March 27 status
     - Verify "Project Status Dashboard" accuracy
     - Update "Current Focus" section
     - Verify all links are functional
     - Add "Documentation Organization" section explaining the structure

## Cross-Reference System

To improve navigation between related documents, implement a cross-reference system:

1. **Document Index Files**
   - Update all `index.md` files to include comprehensive lists of related documents
   - Organize documents by topic, service, and status

2. **Service-Specific Indexes**
   - Create service-specific index files that list all documentation related to a particular service
   - Include links to API references, troubleshooting guides, and implementation documents

3. **Topic-Based Indexes**
   - Create topic-based index files for common topics like "Troubleshooting", "Model Standardization", etc.
   - Include links to all documents related to the topic

4. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
   - Implement breadcrumb navigation at the top of each document
   - Show the document's location in the overall documentation structure
