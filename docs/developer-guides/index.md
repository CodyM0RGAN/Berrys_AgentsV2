## Development Principles

When developing for Berrys_AgentsV2, adhere to these core principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each service should have a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Microservice Architecture**: Services should be independent and loosely coupled
3. **API-First Design**: Define clear API contracts before implementation
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before or alongside code
5. **Documentation**: Document all public APIs and interfaces
6. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and practices
7. **Modularity**: Design for extensibility and reusability

## Getting Started

To get started with development, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment by following the [Environment Setup](environment-setup.md) guide
2. Familiarize yourself with the [Service Structure](service-development/service-structure.md) and [Design Patterns](service-development/design-patterns.md)
3. Choose a service to work on or create a new one
4. Follow the development workflow outlined above
