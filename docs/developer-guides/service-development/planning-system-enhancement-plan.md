## Overview

The Planning System is responsible for generating strategic plans, breaking down plans into executable tasks, and forecasting project timelines. It consists of three main components:

1. **Planning Strategist**: Handles high-level planning capabilities
2. **Planning Tactician**: Breaks down plans into executable tasks
3. **Project Forecaster**: Predicts timelines and identifies bottlenecks

These components work together to provide comprehensive planning capabilities for the Berrys_AgentsV2 framework. The Planning System interacts with the Agent Orchestrator to assign tasks to agents and with the Project Coordinator to update project status.

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Planning Strategist | ðŸ”„ In Progress | 70% | Enhanced strategic planning capabilities |
| Planning Tactician | ðŸ”„ In Progress | 50% | Improved task breakdown functionality |
| Project Forecaster | ðŸ”„ In Progress | 40% | Initial implementation of forecasting features |

The Planning System has been standardized as part of the Service Standardization initiative, with models, enums, and database schema aligned with the shared components. The service has been refactored into smaller, more manageable modules following the Single Responsibility Principle, making it easier to implement and maintain the enhanced capabilities.
