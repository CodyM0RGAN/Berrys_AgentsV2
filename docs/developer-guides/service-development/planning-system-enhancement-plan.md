## Overview

The Planning System is responsible for generating strategic plans, breaking down plans into executable tasks, and forecasting project timelines. It consists of three main components:

1. **Planning Strategist**: Handles high-level planning capabilities
2. **Planning Tactician**: Breaks down plans into executable tasks
3. **Project Forecaster**: Predicts timelines and identifies bottlenecks

These components work together to provide comprehensive planning capabilities for the Berrys_AgentsV2 framework. The Planning System interacts with the Agent Orchestrator to assign tasks to agents and with the Project Coordinator to update project status.

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Planning Strategist | üîÑ In Progress | 40% | Basic strategic planning capabilities |
| Planning Tactician | üîÑ In Progress | 30% | Basic task breakdown functionality |
| Project Forecaster | üìù Planned | 10% | Initial design only |

The Planning System has been standardized as part of the Service Standardization initiative, with models, enums, and database schema aligned with the shared components. However, the core functionality needs enhancement to support the full range of planning capabilities required by the framework.

## Enhancement Goals

### 1. Planning Strategist Enhancement

- **Goal**: Improve high-level planning capabilities to generate comprehensive strategic plans
- **Current Limitations**:
  - Limited ability to generate multi-phase plans
  - Lack of resource allocation planning
  - No support for dependency management between phases
- **Target Capabilities**:
  - Generate multi-phase plans with clear objectives and deliverables
  - Allocate resources based on project requirements
  - Manage dependencies between phases
  - Adapt plans based on project constraints and priorities
  - Support different planning methodologies (Agile, Waterfall, etc.)

### 2. Planning Tactician Enhancement

- **Goal**: Improve task breakdown functionality to generate executable tasks from strategic plans
- **Current Limitations**:
  - Basic task generation without considering dependencies
  - Limited ability to assign tasks to agents
  - No support for task prioritization
- **Target Capabilities**:
  - Break down strategic plans into executable tasks with clear acceptance criteria
  - Identify dependencies between tasks
  - Assign tasks to agents based on capabilities and availability
  - Prioritize tasks based on project goals and constraints
  - Generate task sequences that optimize for parallel execution

### 3. Project Forecaster Implementation

- **Goal**: Implement project forecasting features to predict timelines and identify bottlenecks
- **Current Limitations**:
  - No forecasting capabilities
  - No ability to identify bottlenecks
  - No support for what-if analysis
- **Target Capabilities**:
  - Predict project timelines based on task estimates and dependencies
  - Identify critical path and bottlenecks
  - Perform what-if analysis for different scenarios
  - Provide early warnings for potential delays
  - Recommend adjustments to improve project outcomes
