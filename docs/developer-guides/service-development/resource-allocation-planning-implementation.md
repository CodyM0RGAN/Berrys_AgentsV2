## Overview

Resource allocation planning is a critical component of the Planning System, enabling the assignment of resources to tasks based on availability, skills, and constraints. This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for managing resources, allocating them to tasks, and optimizing resource utilization across projects.

The implementation includes:

1. **Resource Management**: CRUD operations for resources
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assigning resources to tasks
3. **Resource Utilization Analysis**: Analyzing resource utilization and identifying overallocation
4. **Resource Optimization**: Optimizing resource allocation based on various constraints

## Implementation Details

### Components Implemented

1. **ResourceModel**: Database model for resources
2. **ResourceAllocationModel**: Database model for resource allocations
3. **ResourceService**: Service for managing resources and allocations
4. **Repository Methods**: CRUD operations for resources and allocations
5. **API Endpoints**: REST API for resource management
6. **Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions for resource-related errors

### Architecture

The resource allocation planning implementation follows the same architecture as the rest of the Planning System service:

```

│   └── exceptions.py            # Custom exceptions
```

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints have been implemented for resource management:

### Resource Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/resources` | Create a new resource |
| GET | `/resources/{resource_id}` | Get a resource by ID |
| GET | `/resources` | List resources with filtering and pagination |
| PATCH | `/resources/{resource_id}` | Update a resource |
| DELETE | `/resources/{resource_id}` | Delete a resource |
| GET | `/resources/{resource_id}/utilization` | Get utilization for a resource |
| GET | `/resources/utilization` | Get utilization for all resources |

### Resource Allocation Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/resources/{resource_id}/allocations` | Create a new allocation |
| GET | `/resources/{resource_id}/allocations` | List allocations for a resource |
| GET | `/resources/allocations/{allocation_id}` | Get an allocation by ID |
| PATCH | `/resources/allocations/{allocation_id}` | Update an allocation |
| DELETE | `/resources/allocations/{allocation_id}` | Delete an allocation |

## Data Models

### Resource Model

The `ResourceModel` represents a resource that can be allocated to tasks:

```python
class ResourceModel(StandardModel):
    """Resource database model"""
    __tablename__ = "resource"
    
    name = Column(String(200), nullable=False)
    resource_type = enum_column(ResourceType, nullable=False)
    description = Column(Text, nullable=True)
    skills = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    availability = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    capacity_hours = Column(Float, nullable=False, default=40.0)
    cost_rate = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    constraints = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    external_id = Column(String(100), nullable=True)
```

### Resource Allocation Model

The `ResourceAllocationModel` represents the allocation of a resource to a task:

```python
class ResourceAllocationModel(StandardModel):
    """Resource allocation database model"""
    __tablename__ = "resource_allocation"
    
    task_id = Column(UUID, ForeignKey("planning_task.id"), nullable=False)
    resource_id = Column(UUID, ForeignKey("resource.id"), nullable=False)
    allocation_percentage = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    assigned_hours = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    start_date = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)
    end_date = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)
    is_overallocated = Column(Boolean, default=False)
```

## Resource Allocation Algorithms

The resource allocation algorithms implemented in the `ResourceService` and `ResourceOptimizer` classes provide the following capabilities:

1. **Resource Allocation**: Assigning resources to tasks based on availability and skills
2. **Overallocation Detection**: Identifying when a resource is allocated beyond its capacity
3. **Utilization Analysis**: Analyzing resource utilization across projects
4. **Optimization**: Optimizing resource allocation based on various constraints

### Allocation Algorithm

The allocation algorithm considers the following factors:

1. **Resource Capacity**: The number of hours a resource is available per week
2. **Task Requirements**: The skills and effort required for a task
3. **Existing Allocations**: The resource's existing allocations
4. **Constraints**: Any constraints on the resource or task

When creating a new allocation, the algorithm:

1. Verifies that the resource and task exist
2. Calculates the total allocated hours for the resource
3. Determines if the new allocation would cause overallocation
4. Creates the allocation with the appropriate overallocation flag

### Utilization Analysis

The utilization analysis algorithm:

1. Retrieves all resources matching the specified filters
2. For each resource, retrieves all allocations
3. Calculates the total allocated hours and utilization percentage
4. Identifies overallocated resources
5. Generates a summary of resource utilization

## Integration with Agent Orchestrator

The resource allocation planning implementation integrates with the Agent Orchestrator service to:

1. **Retrieve Agent Capabilities**: Get information about agent capabilities for resource allocation
2. **Assign Tasks to Agents**: Assign tasks to agents based on resource allocation
3. **Update Task Status**: Update task status based on agent progress

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for the resource allocation planning implementation includes:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test resource creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
   - Test allocation creation, retrieval, update, and deletion
   - Test utilization analysis
   - Test overallocation detection

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test integration with the Planning System
   - Test integration with the Agent Orchestrator
   - Test end-to-end resource allocation workflows

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Test resource allocation performance with large numbers of resources and tasks
   - Test optimization algorithm performance

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements to the resource allocation planning implementation include:

1. **Advanced Optimization Algorithms**: Implement more sophisticated optimization algorithms
2. **Resource Leveling**: Implement resource leveling to balance workload
3. **Skill-Based Allocation**: Enhance skill-based allocation with skill proficiency levels
4. **Availability Calendar**: Implement a calendar-based availability system
5. **Resource Forecasting**: Implement resource forecasting for future projects
6. **Resource Constraints**: Enhance resource constraints with more complex rules
7. **Resource Groups**: Implement resource groups for team-based allocation
