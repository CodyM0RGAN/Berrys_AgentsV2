## Overview

The Agent Specialization feature enhances the Agent Generation Engine by providing database-driven agent specializations. This allows for dynamic configuration of agent specializations based on their types, which improves the flexibility and adaptability of the agent generation process.

The feature includes:

1. Database tables to store agent specializations
2. Service layer for managing agent specializations
3. API endpoints for CRUD operations
4. Integration with the requirement analysis service
5. Migration scripts for database setup

## Implementation Details

### Components

The Agent Specialization feature consists of the following components:

1. **Database Schema**: Tables for storing agent specializations and collaboration patterns
2. **Agent Specialization Service**: Service for managing agent specializations
3. **API Endpoints**: Endpoints for CRUD operations
4. **Requirement Analysis Integration**: Integration with the requirement analysis service
5. **Migration Scripts**: Scripts for setting up the database schema and default data

### Dependencies

The Agent Specialization feature depends on the following components:

1. **Agent Orchestrator**: Provides the base infrastructure for the feature
2. **Database**: Stores agent specializations and collaboration patterns
3. **Requirement Analysis Service**: Uses agent specializations for requirement analysis
4. **Agent Type Enum**: Defines the types of agents that can be specialized

## Database Schema

The Agent Specialization feature uses two database tables:

1. **agent_specialization**: Stores the basic information about agent specializations
2. **agent_collaboration_pattern**: Stores the collaboration patterns for agent specializations

For the detailed schema, see the [agent_specialization_migration.sql](../../../shared/database/agent_specialization_migration.sql) file.

## Service Implementation

The Agent Specialization feature is implemented in the following files:

1. **AgentSpecializationService**: [agent_specialization_service.py](../../../services/agent-orchestrator/src/services/agent_specialization_service.py)
2. **RequirementAnalysisService Integration**: [requirement_analysis_service.py](../../../services/agent-orchestrator/src/services/requirement_analysis_service.py)
3. **Exception Handling**: [exceptions.py](../../../services/agent-orchestrator/src/exceptions.py)

The `AgentSpecializationService` provides methods for managing agent specializations, including:

- `get_agent_specialization`: Get agent specialization by agent type
- `list_agent_specializations`: List all agent specializations
- `create_agent_specialization`: Create a new agent specialization
- `update_agent_specialization`: Update an agent specialization
- `delete_agent_specialization`: Delete an agent specialization

The `RequirementAnalysisService` has been updated to use the `AgentSpecializationService` for retrieving agent specializations instead of using hardcoded defaults.

## API Endpoints

The Agent Specialization feature provides the following API endpoints:

1. **List Agent Specializations**: `GET /api/specializations`
2. **Get Agent Specialization**: `GET /api/specializations/{agent_type}`
3. **Create Agent Specialization**: `POST /api/specializations`
4. **Update Agent Specialization**: `PUT /api/specializations/{agent_type}`
5. **Delete Agent Specialization**: `DELETE /api/specializations/{agent_type}`

The API endpoints are implemented in the [specializations.py](../../../services/agent-orchestrator/src/routers/specializations.py) file.

## Integration with Requirement Analysis

The Agent Specialization feature is integrated with the Requirement Analysis service through the `RequirementAnalysisService` class. The service uses the `AgentSpecializationService` to retrieve agent specializations from the database instead of using hardcoded defaults.

The integration flow is as follows:

1. The `RequirementAnalysisService` receives a request to analyze project requirements
2. The service extracts requirements from the project description
3. The service categorizes and prioritizes the requirements
4. The service determines the required agent specializations
5. For each agent type, the service retrieves the specialization from the database
6. If a specialization is not found, the service uses a default specialization
7. The service generates a collaboration graph based on the specializations
8. The service returns the analysis result

## Migration Scripts

The Agent Specialization feature includes migration scripts for setting up the database schema and default data:

1. **SQL Migration Script**: [agent_specialization_migration.sql](../../../shared/database/agent_specialization_migration.sql)
2. **PowerShell Script (Windows)**: [apply_agent_specialization_migration.ps1](../../../scripts/apply_agent_specialization_migration.ps1)
3. **Bash Script (Linux/macOS)**: [apply_agent_specialization_migration.sh](../../../scripts/apply_agent_specialization_migration.sh)

To apply the migration, run the appropriate script for your platform:

### Windows

```powershell
# From the project root directory
.\scripts\apply_agent_specialization_migration.ps1
```

### Linux/macOS

```bash
# From the project root directory
./scripts/apply_agent_specialization_migration.sh
```
