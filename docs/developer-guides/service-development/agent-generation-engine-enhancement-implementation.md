## Overview

The Agent Generation Engine enhancement focuses on improving the agent generation capabilities by integrating with the Agent Specialization System and implementing collaboration pattern identification. This enhancement enables the Agent Generation Engine to create specialized agents based on project requirements and define collaboration patterns between agents.

The implementation includes:

1. Integration with the Agent Specialization System
2. Collaboration pattern identification
3. Integration with the Model Orchestration service for specialized prompts

## Implementation Details

### Components

The Agent Generation Engine enhancement consists of the following components:

1. **CollaborationPatternService**: A new service for identifying and managing collaboration patterns between agents
2. **RequirementAnalysisService**: Enhanced to use the CollaborationPatternService for generating collaboration graphs
3. **Model Orchestration Integration**: Enhanced to support agent specialization in model requests

### Dependencies

The Agent Generation Engine enhancement depends on the following components:

1. **Agent Specialization System**: Provides agent specialization information
2. **Model Orchestration Service**: Provides access to AI models with specialization support
3. **Agent Communication Hub**: Provides communication capabilities between agents

## Agent Specialization Integration

The Agent Specialization System has been integrated with the Agent Generation Engine to provide specialization information for agents. This integration enables the Agent Generation Engine to create specialized agents based on project requirements.

### Implementation

1. **RequirementAnalysisService**: Enhanced to use the AgentSpecializationService for retrieving agent specialization information
2. **Model Orchestration Integration**: Enhanced to support agent specialization in model requests

### Code Changes

The `RequirementAnalysisService` has been updated to use the `AgentSpecializationService` for retrieving agent specialization information:

```python
async def _rule_based_determine_specialization(
    self,
    agent_type: AgentType,
    requirements: List[RequirementItem],
    context: Dict[str, Any],
) -> AgentSpecializationRequirement:
    """
    Determine agent specialization using rule-based approach.
    
    Args:
        agent_type: Agent type
        requirements: List of requirements for this agent type
        context: Additional context
        
    Returns:
        AgentSpecializationRequirement: Agent specialization requirement
    """
    try:
        # Try to get specialization from database
        specialization = await self.agent_specialization_service.get_agent_specialization(agent_type)
        
        # If specialization found, return it
        if specialization:
            return specialization
        
        # If specialization not found, create a default one
        logger.warning(f"Specialization for agent type {agent_type} not found in database, using default")
        
        # Default specialization for unknown agent types
        default_specialization = AgentSpecializationRequirement(
            agent_type=agent_type,
            required_skills=["Adaptability", "Versatility", "Specialized Knowledge"],
            responsibilities=["Perform custom tasks", "Adapt to project needs"],
            knowledge_domains=["Project-Specific Domain"],
            collaboration_patterns=[
                {
                    "collaborator_type": "COORDINATOR",
                    "interaction_type": "RECEIVE_INSTRUCTIONS",
                    "description": "Receive custom instructions"
                }
            ],
        )
        
        return default_specialization
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error determining specialization for agent type {agent_type}: {str(e)}")
        
        # Fallback to a minimal default specialization
        return AgentSpecializationRequirement(
            agent_type=agent_type,
            required_skills=["Adaptability"],
            responsibilities=["Perform tasks"],
            knowledge_domains=["General"],
            collaboration_patterns=[],
        )
```

## Collaboration Pattern Implementation

The Collaboration Pattern feature has been fully implemented to enable the definition, management, and application of collaboration patterns between agents. This implementation includes:

1. **CollaborationPatternService**: A service for managing collaboration patterns
2. **CollaborationPatternRouter**: API endpoints for managing collaboration patterns
3. **CollaborationPattern Models**: Data models for collaboration patterns
4. **Database Schema**: Tables and indexes for storing collaboration patterns
5. **Integration with Agent Communication Hub**: Applying collaboration patterns to agent communication

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for managing collaboration patterns:

- `GET /api/patterns`: List all collaboration patterns
- `GET /api/patterns/{pattern_id}`: Get a specific collaboration pattern
- `POST /api/patterns`: Create a new collaboration pattern
- `PUT /api/patterns/{pattern_id}`: Update an existing collaboration pattern
- `DELETE /api/patterns/{pattern_id}`: Delete a collaboration pattern
- `GET /api/patterns/project/{project_id}/graph`: Get the collaboration graph for a project
- `POST /api/patterns/project/{project_id}/setup-communication`: Setup communication rules for a project

### Database Schema

A new `collaboration_pattern` table has been created to store collaboration patterns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS collaboration_pattern (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    source_agent_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    target_agent_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    interaction_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    priority INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    metadata JSONB,
    source_agent_id UUID,
    target_agent_id UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Integration with Agent Communication Hub

The Collaboration Pattern feature integrates with the Agent Communication Hub to apply collaboration patterns to agent communication. This integration enables:

1. **Rule-Based Routing**: Messages are routed based on collaboration patterns
2. **Priority-Based Queuing**: Messages are prioritized based on collaboration patterns
3. **Content-Based Routing**: Messages are routed based on their content and the collaboration patterns
4. **Topic-Based Routing**: Messages are routed based on topics defined by collaboration patterns

For more details, see the [Collaboration Pattern Implementation](collaboration-pattern-implementation.md) document.

## Model Orchestration Integration

The Model Orchestration service has been enhanced to support agent specialization in model requests. This integration enables the Agent Generation Engine to request specialized prompts from the Model Orchestration service based on agent specialization.

### Implementation

1. **RequestBase**: Enhanced to include agent specialization information
2. **ModelOrchestrationConfig**: Enhanced to include agent orchestrator URL
3. **RequestProcessingMixin**: Enhanced to retrieve agent specialization information and enhance prompts

### Code Changes

The `RequestBase` model has been updated to include agent specialization information:

```python
class RequestBase(BaseEntityModel):
    """
    Base model for a model request.
    """
    request_type: RequestType
    model_id: Optional[str] = None
    provider: Optional[ModelProvider] = None

    agent_specialization_id: Optional[str] = None # ID of the agent specialization requesting the model interaction
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```

The `ModelOrchestrationConfig` class has been updated to include the agent orchestrator URL:

```python
class ModelOrchestrationConfig(BaseServiceConfig):
    """
    Configuration for the Model Orchestration service.
    """
    # Service information
    service_name: str = Field("model-orchestration", description="Service name")

    max_retries: int = Field(3, description="Maximum number of retries")
    retry_delay: float = Field(1.0, description="Delay between retries in seconds")
```

The `RequestProcessingMixin` class has been enhanced to retrieve agent specialization information and enhance prompts:

```python
async def _get_agent_specialization(self, agent_specialization_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Get agent specialization information from the Agent Orchestrator service.

        if not agent_orchestrator_url:
            logger.warning("Agent Orchestrator URL not configured, skipping specialization lookup")
            return None
            
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(
