## Overview

The Collaboration Pattern feature is a key component of the Agent Generation Engine enhancement. It enables the definition, management, and application of collaboration patterns between agents, which are essential for effective multi-agent collaboration.

Collaboration patterns define how agents interact with each other, including:

- Which agents can communicate with each other
- What types of interactions are allowed
- The priority of different types of interactions
- The routing rules for messages between agents

This implementation provides a comprehensive set of API endpoints for managing collaboration patterns, a database schema for storing them, and integration with the Agent Communication Hub for applying the patterns to agent communication.

## Implementation Details

### Components

The Collaboration Pattern implementation consists of the following components:

1. **CollaborationPatternService**: A service for managing collaboration patterns
2. **CollaborationPatternRouter**: API endpoints for managing collaboration patterns
3. **CollaborationPattern Models**: Data models for collaboration patterns
4. **Database Schema**: Tables and indexes for storing collaboration patterns
5. **Integration with Agent Communication Hub**: Applying collaboration patterns to agent communication

### Dependencies

The Collaboration Pattern implementation depends on the following components:

1. **Agent Specialization System**: Provides agent specialization information
2. **Agent Communication Hub**: Provides communication capabilities between agents
3. **Model Orchestration Service**: Provides access to AI models for pattern recognition

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for managing collaboration patterns:

### List Collaboration Patterns

```
GET /api/patterns
```

List all collaboration patterns with optional filtering by source agent type, target agent type, and interaction type.

### Get Collaboration Pattern

```
GET /api/patterns/{pattern_id}
```

Get a specific collaboration pattern by ID.

### Create Collaboration Pattern

```
POST /api/patterns
```

Create a new collaboration pattern.

### Update Collaboration Pattern

```
PUT /api/patterns/{pattern_id}
```

Update an existing collaboration pattern.

### Delete Collaboration Pattern

```
DELETE /api/patterns/{pattern_id}
```

Delete a collaboration pattern.

### Get Collaboration Graph

```
GET /api/patterns/project/{project_id}/graph
```

Get the collaboration graph for a project, showing all agents and their collaboration patterns.

### Setup Communication Rules

```
POST /api/patterns/project/{project_id}/setup-communication
```

Setup communication rules based on collaboration patterns for a project.

## Database Schema

The collaboration pattern feature uses the following database schema:

### collaboration_pattern Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS collaboration_pattern (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    source_agent_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    target_agent_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    interaction_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    priority INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    metadata JSONB,
    source_agent_id UUID,
    target_agent_id UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_collaboration_pattern_source_agent_type ON collaboration_pattern(source_agent_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_collaboration_pattern_target_agent_type ON collaboration_pattern(target_agent_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_collaboration_pattern_interaction_type ON collaboration_pattern(interaction_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_collaboration_pattern_source_agent_id ON collaboration_pattern(source_agent_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_collaboration_pattern_target_agent_id ON collaboration_pattern(target_agent_id);
```

## Integration with Agent Communication Hub

The Collaboration Pattern feature integrates with the Agent Communication Hub to apply collaboration patterns to agent communication. This integration enables:

1. **Rule-Based Routing**: Messages are routed based on collaboration patterns
2. **Priority-Based Queuing**: Messages are prioritized based on collaboration patterns
3. **Content-Based Routing**: Messages are routed based on their content and the collaboration patterns
4. **Topic-Based Routing**: Messages are routed based on topics defined by collaboration patterns

The integration is implemented in the `CollaborationPatternService` class, which provides methods for setting up communication rules based on collaboration patterns:

- `setup_communication_rules`: Sets up communication rules based on collaboration patterns
- `setup_project_communication_rules`: Sets up communication rules for a project

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Collaboration Pattern

```python
# Create a collaboration pattern
pattern = CollaborationPatternCreate(
    source_agent_type="DEVELOPER",
    target_agent_type="DESIGNER",
    interaction_type="REQUEST_REVIEW",
    description="Request UI design review",
    priority=2,
    metadata={
        "tags": ["design", "review"],
        "frequency": "as-needed"
    }
)

# Call the API
response = await client.post("/api/patterns", json=pattern.dict())
```

### Setting Up Communication Rules

```python
# Setup communication rules for a project
response = await client.post(f"/api/patterns/project/{project_id}/setup-communication")
```

### Getting the Collaboration Graph

```python
# Get the collaboration graph for a project
response = await client.get(f"/api/patterns/project/{project_id}/graph")
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Collaboration Pattern feature include:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically recognize collaboration patterns from agent interactions
2. **Pattern Optimization**: Optimize collaboration patterns based on agent performance
3. **Pattern Visualization**: Visualize collaboration patterns in the Web Dashboard
4. **Pattern Templates**: Create and apply collaboration pattern templates
5. **Pattern Analytics**: Analyze the effectiveness of collaboration patterns
