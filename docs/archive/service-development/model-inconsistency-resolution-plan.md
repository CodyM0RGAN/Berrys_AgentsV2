# Model Inconsistency Resolution Plan

> **Note**: This is a historical document that outlines the original implementation plan. For the current status of the model standardization project, please refer to the [Model Standardization Progress](./model-standardization-progress.md) document.

This document outlines the implementation plan for resolving inconsistencies between Pydantic models, SQLAlchemy models, and PostgreSQL database tables in the Berrys_AgentsV2 project.

## Implementation Plan Overview

### Phase 0: Database Structure Verification (1-2 days) - COMPLETED
- [x] Create implementation plan document
- [x] Verify table names and structure
- [x] Check table naming conventions
- [x] Verify metadata column renaming
- [x] Check enum implementation
- [x] Document differences between services
- [x] Create database structure report

### Phase 1: Assessment and Preparation (1-2 days) - COMPLETED
- [x] Full codebase audit
- [x] Standards decision
- [x] Database backup
- [x] Monitoring setup

## Phase 1: Assessment and Preparation - Full Codebase Audit

We've conducted a comprehensive audit of all model files across services in the project. The detailed findings are documented in [Model Audit Findings](./model-audit-findings.md).

Key findings from the audit:

1. **Table Naming Conventions**:
   - Web Dashboard uses singular table names (e.g., 'project', 'agent')
   - Project Coordinator uses plural table names (e.g., 'projects', 'project_states')

2. **Enum Handling**:
   - Web Dashboard uses string columns
   - Project Coordinator uses SQLAlchemy Enum columns
   - Shared Pydantic Models use Enum classes

3. **Metadata Column Naming**:
   - Inconsistent presence of metadata columns
   - Tool model has tool_metadata in code but not in database

4. **Entity Representation**:
   - Agent is represented differently in Web Dashboard vs. Project Coordinator
   - Project Coordinator has more detailed models for some entities

5. **Model-to-API Conversion**:
   - Web Dashboard has standardized conversion methods
   - Project Coordinator lacks standardized conversion methods

6. **Database Synchronization**:
   - Project Coordinator models haven't been migrated to the database

These findings confirm the need for our standardization efforts and provide a clear roadmap for the implementation phases.

## Phase 1: Assessment and Preparation - Database Backup

Before making any changes to the database schema, we need to create a backup of the current database. This will allow us to restore the database to its current state if anything goes wrong during the migration process.

Steps for database backup:

1. Create a full database dump:
   ```bash
   docker exec berrys_agentsv2-postgres-1 pg_dump -U sa -d mas_framework > mas_framework_backup.sql
   ```

2. Create a backup of the database schema only:
   ```bash
   docker exec berrys_agentsv2-postgres-1 pg_dump -U sa -d mas_framework --schema-only > mas_framework_schema_backup.sql
   ```

3. Store backups in a safe location:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   mv mas_framework_backup.sql backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
   mv mas_framework_schema_backup.sql backups/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
   ```

## Phase 1: Assessment and Preparation - Monitoring Setup

To ensure we can quickly identify and address any issues that arise during the implementation of our plan, we need to set up monitoring for database operations and application errors.

Steps for monitoring setup:

1. Add logging for database operations:
   - Add logging to SQLAlchemy session operations
   - Log all schema migrations
   - Log any errors during database operations

2. Set up application error monitoring:
   - Add error handlers to catch and log any exceptions
   - Configure alerts for critical errors
   - Monitor application logs for warnings and errors

3. Create database health checks:
   - Add health check endpoints to each service
   - Monitor database connection pool
   - Track query performance

## Phase 1: Assessment and Preparation - Standards Decision

Based on our database structure verification findings, we've made the following standards decisions for the project going forward:

### Table Naming Convention

**Decision**: Use singular table names throughout the project.

**Rationale**:
- The majority of existing tables use singular names (agent, project, task, tool, user)
- All foreign key references are to singular table names
- The web-dashboard service, which is the primary service using the database, uses singular table names
- This is consistent with SQLAlchemy's documentation which recommends singular table names

### Enum Handling

**Decision**: Use string columns with validation in SQLAlchemy models, and Enum classes in Pydantic models.

**Rationale**:
- String columns are more flexible and easier to migrate
- Validation can be added in the SQLAlchemy models to ensure only valid enum values are used
- Pydantic models can use Enum classes for type safety and validation
- This approach provides the benefits of both worlds while avoiding the complexity of PostgreSQL enum types

### Metadata Column Naming

**Decision**: Use entity-specific prefixes for all metadata columns (e.g., project_metadata, tool_metadata).

**Rationale**:
- Avoids conflicts with SQLAlchemy's reserved 'metadata' name
- Provides clarity about what the metadata relates to
- Consistent with existing renamed columns in the database

### Base Model Structure

**Decision**: Create a shared BaseModel in the shared module that all services can use.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent field definitions across services
- Simplifies maintenance and updates
- Provides a single source of truth for common fields

### Model-to-API Conversion

**Decision**: Create a standardized conversion layer with consistent methods for all entities.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent handling of field conversions
- Simplifies maintenance and updates
- Provides clear documentation of the conversion process

### Entity Representation

**Decision**: For entities with different representations across services, create clear mapping documentation and adapter classes.

**Rationale**:
- Acknowledges that different services may need different representations
- Provides a clear path for data transformation between services
- Ensures data integrity across service boundaries

### Phase 2: Table Naming Convention Standardization (2-3 days) - COMPLETED
- [x] Create migration scripts
- [x] Update foreign key references
- [x] Update model definitions
- [x] Update query references

### Phase 3: Metadata Column Remediation (1-2 days) - COMPLETED
- [x] Audit remaining metadata columns
- [x] Create migration scripts for any missed columns
- [x] Update model definitions
- [x] Update API conversion logic

## Phase 3: Metadata Column Remediation - Audit Remaining Metadata Columns

We've audited the metadata columns in all tables and found the following issues:

1. **Missing Metadata Columns**:
   - The 'tool' table doesn't have a 'tool_metadata' column, even though the code model has it.

2. **Inconsistent Naming**:
   - All metadata columns should follow the pattern `<entity>_metadata` (e.g., 'project_metadata', 'tool_metadata').

3. **API Conversion**:
   - The API conversion methods in the web-dashboard service map the `<entity>_metadata` columns to 'metadata' in the API models for backward compatibility.
   - This is a good approach, but it should be standardized across all services.

### Phase 4: Enum Handling Standardization (2-3 days) - COMPLETED
- [x] Select standardized approach
- [x] Create migration scripts
- [x] Update model definitions
- [x] Update API conversion methods

### Phase 5: Model Structure Alignment (3-4 days) - COMPLETED

## Phase 0: Database Structure Verification - Findings

### Table Names and Structure

The database contains 27 tables, with a mix of singular and plural naming conventions:

```
table_name
-----------------------------
 agent
 agent_tools
 ai_model
 approval_request
 audit_log
 clarification_request
 communication
 feedback_request
 human_interaction
 model_budget
 model_feedback
 model_performance
 model_performance_history
 model_performance_metric
 model_usage
 models
 notification
 optimization_implementation
 optimization_suggestion
 performance_metric
 project
 provider_quotas
 requests
 task
 task_dependencies
 tool
 user
```

### Table Naming Conventions

There's an inconsistency in table naming conventions:

1. **Singular Table Names (Web Dashboard Service)**:
   - agent
   - ai_model
   - communication
   - project
   - task
   - tool
   - user

2. **Plural Table Names**:
   - models
   - requests
   - provider_quotas
   - task_dependencies
   - agent_tools

3. **Missing Tables**:
   - The 'projects' table from the project-coordinator service doesn't exist in the database, suggesting that the project-coordinator service's models haven't been migrated to the database yet.

### Metadata Column Status

The metadata column renaming has been partially applied:

1. **Tables with Renamed Metadata Columns**:
   - project - project_metadata
   - models - model_metadata
   - communication - communication_metadata

2. **No Tables with 'metadata' Column**:
   - All 'metadata' columns have been renamed with entity-specific prefixes, which is good for avoiding SQLAlchemy conflicts.

3. **Inconsistencies**:
   - The 'tool' table doesn't have a 'tool_metadata' column, even though the code model has it.

### Enum Implementation

There's an inconsistency in enum handling:

1. **Custom Enum Types**:
   - modelprovider (OPENAI, ANTHROPIC, OLLAMA, CUSTOM)
   - modelstatus (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, DEPRECATED)
   - requesttype (CHAT, COMPLETION, EMBEDDING, IMAGE_GENERATION, AUDIO_TRANSCRIPTION, AUDIO_TRANSLATION)

2. **String-Based Enums**:
   - Most tables use string columns for enum-like fields (e.g., 'status', 'type')
   - For example, 'project.status' and 'agent.status' are VARCHAR columns, not enum types

### Service Differences

1. **Web Dashboard vs. Project Coordinator**:
   - Web Dashboard uses singular table names (e.g., 'project', 'agent')
   - Project Coordinator uses plural table names (e.g., 'projects'), but these tables don't exist in the database yet

2. **Foreign Key Relationships**:
   - All foreign key references are to singular table names
   - This suggests that the Web Dashboard's naming convention is the primary one in use

3. **Empty Database**:
   - All tables are currently empty, suggesting that the application hasn't been fully initialized yet
