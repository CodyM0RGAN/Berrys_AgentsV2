## Incident Classification

Incidents are classified based on severity and impact on users and business operations:

### P1 - Critical

- **Description**: Severe impact on critical services affecting all users
- **Examples**: 
  - Production system is completely down or unavailable
  - Data breach or security compromise
  - Complete failure of core services (API Gateway, Agent Orchestrator, Model Orchestration)
- **Response Time**: Immediate (24/7)
- **Resolution Target**: 4 hours
- **Escalation**: Immediate to senior engineering and management

### P2 - High

- **Description**: Significant impact on important services affecting many users
- **Examples**:
  - Partial system outage
  - Significant performance degradation affecting user experience
  - Major feature not functioning
- **Response Time**: 1 hour (business hours), 4 hours (non-business hours)
- **Resolution Target**: 8 hours
- **Escalation**: Engineering leads within 2 hours

### P3 - Medium

- **Description**: Moderate impact on non-critical services affecting some users
- **Examples**:
  - Minor feature not functioning
  - Performance issues affecting a subset of users
  - Non-critical component failure
- **Response Time**: 4 hours (business hours), next business day (non-business hours)
- **Resolution Target**: 24 hours
- **Escalation**: Engineering team within 8 hours

### P4 - Low

- **Description**: Minimal impact on services affecting few users
- **Examples**:
  - Cosmetic issues
  - Minor bugs
  - Feature requests misclassified as incidents
- **Response Time**: Next business day
- **Resolution Target**: 1 week
- **Escalation**: Regular support channels

  - Send initial notification to stakeholders

- **For P3/P4 Incidents**:
  - Create incident ticket
  - Assign appropriate resources
  - Update status page if necessary

### 3. Investigation

- **Actions**:
  - Gather relevant information
  - Review logs and metrics
  - Identify affected systems
  - Determine scope and impact
  - Identify potential causes
  - Document findings

### 4. Mitigation

- **Actions**:
  - Develop mitigation plan
  - Implement temporary fixes
  - Verify mitigation effectiveness
  - Update stakeholders on progress
  - Document mitigation steps

### 5. Resolution

- **Actions**:
  - Implement permanent fixes
  - Verify system stability
  - Close incident channel
  - Update incident ticket
  - Send resolution notification
  - Schedule post-incident review

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communication

- **Slack Channel**: Primary real-time communication
  - Create #incident-[date]-[short-description]
  - Add relevant team members
  - Pin important information
  - Use threads for specific discussions

- **Video Calls**:
  - Use for complex incidents requiring real-time collaboration
  - Record key decisions in the Slack channel

- **Internal Status Page**:
  - Update with current status
  - Include estimated resolution time
  - Link to incident channel

### External Communication

- **User Notifications**:
  - Craft clear, concise messages
  - Include affected services
  - Provide estimated resolution time
  - Update regularly

- **Status Page**:
  - Update within 15 minutes of incident confirmation
  - Include incident classification
  - Provide regular updates (at least hourly for P1/P2)

- **Email Communication**:
  - Send to affected customers for P1/P2 incidents
  - Include incident summary, impact, and current status
  - Send follow-up after resolution

## Common Incidents and Playbooks

### Service Outage

1. **Verification**:
   - Check service health endpoints
   - Verify through monitoring dashboards
   - Confirm if the issue affects all users or a subset

2. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Check for recent deployments - roll back if necessary
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Restart affected services if necessary
   - Scale up resources if under load

3. **Resolution Steps**:
   - Identify root cause through logs and metrics
   - Implement permanent fix
   - Verify service stability
   - Update monitoring thresholds if needed

### Database Performance Issues

1. **Verification**:
   - Check database metrics (connections, query times, locks)
   - Review slow query logs
   - Identify specific slow queries or operations

2. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Kill long-running queries if blocking others
   - Restart database replicas
   - Scale up database resources
   - Enable query caching
   - Implement read replicas for load balancing

3. **Resolution Steps**:
   - Optimize problematic queries
   - Add appropriate indices
   - Update database configuration
   - Consider schema changes for long-term performance

### Security Incidents

1. **Verification**:
   - Confirm nature and scope of the security incident
   - Identify affected systems and data
   - Assess potential impact

2. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Enable additional logging
   - Preserve evidence for investigation

3. **Resolution Steps**:
   - Close security vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups if necessary
   - Conduct security audit
   - Update security measures
   - Prepare incident report for regulatory compliance

### API Rate Limiting or Throttling

1. **Verification**:
   - Check API metrics for traffic spikes
   - Identify source of increased traffic
   - Determine if legitimate or potential abuse

2. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Adjust rate limits temporarily
   - Block abusive sources
   - Scale up API services
   - Enable caching where applicable

3. **Resolution Steps**:
   - Implement permanent rate limiting strategy
   - Optimize API performance
