# Production Deployment Verification Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for verifying the successful deployment of services to the production environment as part of the Production Deployment and Scaling milestone. Teams should use this checklist for each service deployment to ensure all verification steps are completed and documented.

## Pre-Deployment Verification

- [ ] No memory leaks are detected

### Security Verification
- [ ] TLS certificates are valid and properly configured
- [ ] Network policies are correctly enforcing access controls
- [ ] Authentication is required for protected endpoints
- [ ] Authorization is correctly controlling access to resources
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed in logs or responses

## Service-Specific Verification

### Agent Orchestrator
