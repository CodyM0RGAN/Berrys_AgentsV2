## 2. Production Deployment Components

### 2.1 Deployment Script

The deployment script (`terraform/production/deployment-scripts/deploy.sh`) automates the production deployment process, including:

- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Kubernetes namespace and resource setup
- Service deployment with blue-green strategy
- Database migrations
- Monitoring configuration

The script follows the deployment process outlined in the Production Deployment Runbook, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments. It also respects the `ENABLE_AUTOSCALING` environment variable to enable or disable auto-scaling features.

### 2.2 Kubernetes Configurations

Kubernetes manifests for each service define:

- Resource requests and limits
- Health checks and probes
- Service networking
- Security contexts and policies

These configurations ensure that services are deployed with the correct resource allocations and security settings.

### 2.3 Auto-scaling Configurations

Auto-scaling configurations (`terraform/production/autoscaling-configs.yaml`) define the scaling behavior for each service, including:

- Minimum and maximum replica counts
- CPU and memory utilization targets
- Custom metric scaling rules
- Scale-up and scale-down behavior

These configurations enable the platform to automatically adjust to changing workloads, ensuring optimal resource utilization and performance. **Auto-scaling is disabled by default** to ensure the platform runs on local resources without requiring cloud infrastructure.

## 3. Performance Optimization

### 3.1 Rate Limiting

The rate limiting implementation (`shared/utils/src/api/rate_limiting.py`) provides:

- Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- Configurable rate limits by service and endpoint
- Rate limit tiers for different user types
- Fallback to in-memory rate limiting for development

Rate limiting prevents service overload and ensures fair resource allocation among clients.

### 3.2 Database Connection Pooling

The connection pooling implementation (`shared/utils/src/database/connection_pool.py`) offers:

- Configurable connection pools for each database
- Connection reuse and recycling
- Monitoring of pool statistics
- Integration with SQLAlchemy ORM

Connection pooling optimizes database resource usage, reducing connection overhead and improving service performance.

### 3.3 Caching Strategies

The caching implementation (`shared/utils/src/caching/redis_cache.py`) provides:

- Redis-based distributed caching
- Configurable TTL for cache entries
- Support for complex data structures
- Cache invalidation mechanisms

Caching reduces database load and improves response times for frequently accessed data.

## 4. Enhanced Observability

### 4.1 Structured Logging

The logging implementation (`shared/utils/src/monitoring/logging.py`) offers:

- JSON-formatted structured logs
- Consistent log schema across services
- Request context tracking with correlation IDs
- Log level configuration by environment

Structured logging improves troubleshooting capabilities and enables log aggregation and analysis.

### 4.2 Monitoring Dashboards

Grafana dashboards (`terraform/production/grafana-dashboards/`) provide:

- Service-level metrics visualization
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Business metrics tracking
- Alerting thresholds and rules

These dashboards enable real-time monitoring of the platform's health and performance.

### 4.3 Custom Metrics

The metrics implementation (`shared/utils/src/monitoring/metrics.py`) offers:

- Prometheus-compatible metrics collection
- Custom business and technical metrics
- Histogram and counter metrics for performance analysis
- Integration with application code

Custom metrics provide insights into platform usage and performance, enabling data-driven optimization.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Auto-scaling Implementation

The auto-scaling implementation uses Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) with both resource-based and custom metric-based scaling rules. Key features include:

- Resource-based scaling using CPU and memory utilization
- Custom metric-based scaling using application metrics
- Different scaling policies for different services
- Pod Disruption Budgets to ensure service availability during scaling

**Auto-scaling is disabled by default** to ensure the platform works without requiring cloud infrastructure or paid subscriptions. To enable auto-scaling, set the `ENABLE_AUTOSCALING` environment variable to `true` when running the deployment script:

```bash
export ENABLE_AUTOSCALING=true
./terraform/production/deployment-scripts/deploy.sh
```

Service-specific scaling configurations (applied only when auto-scaling is enabled):

| Service | Min Replicas | Max Replicas | CPU Target | Memory Target | Custom Metrics |
|---------|--------------|--------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| API Gateway | 3 | 10 | 70% | 75% | - |
| Agent Orchestrator | 2 | 8 | 75% | 80% | Queue Length |
| Model Orchestration | 3 | 12 | 70% | 75% | Queue Length, Latency |
| Tool Integration | 2 | 6 | 75% | 80% | - |
| Web Dashboard | 2 | 6 | 75% | 80% | Requests/Second |

### 5.2 Rate Limiting Configuration

The rate limiting implementation provides different tiers of rate limits:

| Tier | Requests | Window (seconds) | Use Case |
|------|----------|------------------|----------|
| Default | 100 | 60 | Standard API usage |
| Low | 50 | 60 | Resource-intensive operations |
| High | 200 | 60 | High-volume services |
