## Overview

This runbook provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Berrys_AgentsV2 system to a production environment. It covers the preparation, deployment process, verification, and post-deployment tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the deployment process, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Production environment infrastructure is provisioned
   - Network configurations are in place
   - Security groups and access controls are configured
   - SSL certificates are available
   - Domain names are configured

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - CI/CD pipeline is configured
   - Build artifacts are available
   - Docker images are built and pushed to the registry
   - Deployment scripts are available

3. **Database Setup**
   - Production database is provisioned
   - Database schemas are migrated
   - Database access credentials are available

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Monitoring infrastructure is in place
   - Alerting rules are configured
   - Log aggregation system is available

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checks

1. **Verify Build Artifacts**
   - Confirm all services have successful builds
   - Verify Docker image versions and tags
   - Check deployment configuration files

2. **Perform Database Backup**
   - Create a backup of the production database
   - Verify backup integrity
   - Store backup in secure location

3. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Send deployment notification to stakeholders
   - Communicate expected downtime (if any)
   - Share rollback plan

### 2. Deployment Execution

1. **Database Migrations**
   - Run database migrations with rollback plans
   - Verify schema changes
   - Validate data integrity

2. **Service Deployment**
   - Deploy Core Services:
     - Deploy Project Coordinator service
     - Deploy Agent Orchestrator service
     - Deploy Model Orchestration service
     - Verify core services health

   - Deploy Supporting Services:
     - Deploy Planning System service
     - Deploy Tool Integration service
     - Deploy Service Integration service
     - Verify supporting services health

   - Deploy User Interface:
     - Deploy API Gateway service
     - Deploy Web Dashboard service
     - Verify UI services health

3. **Configuration Updates**
   - Update service configurations
   - Apply environment-specific settings
   - Update feature flags

### 3. Deployment Verification

1. **Service Health Checks**
   - Verify all services are running
   - Check service logs for errors
   - Verify service dependencies

2. **Database Checks**
   - Verify database connections
   - Check database performance metrics
   - Validate data integrity

3. **API Validation**
   - Test API endpoints
   - Verify API responses
   - Check API performance

4. **User Flow Validation**
   - Execute core user flows
   - Verify functionality
   - Check performance and response times

### 4. Post-Deployment Tasks

1. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Verify monitoring dashboards
   - Check alert configurations
   - Validate log aggregation

2. **Performance Baseline**
   - Establish performance baseline
   - Record key metrics
   - Document expected behavior

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update deployment documentation
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Update runbook with lessons learned

4. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Send deployment completion notification
   - Share deployment metrics
   - Provide access to monitoring dashboards

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are detected during or after deployment, follow these steps to roll back:

1. **Decision Criteria**
   - Define criteria for rollback decision
   - Identify service-specific rollback thresholds
   - Establish decision-making authority

2. **Rollback Process**
   - Stop the newly deployed services
   - Revert database migrations
   - Deploy previous service versions
   - Restore configurations

3. **Verification After Rollback**
   - Verify service health
   - Check database integrity
   - Test key user flows
   - Confirm monitoring and alerts

4. **Communication**
   - Notify stakeholders of rollback
   - Communicate expected resolution timeline
   - Schedule follow-up deployment

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

For major releases or significant changes, use the Blue-Green deployment strategy:

1. **Preparation**
   - Provision new environment (Green)
   - Deploy new version to Green environment
   - Verify Green environment health

2. **Transition**
   - Switch traffic from Blue to Green environment
   - Monitor Green environment performance
   - Keep Blue environment running

3. **Finalization**
   - Confirm Green environment stability
   - Decommission Blue environment
   - Update documentation

### Canary Deployment

For feature releases or moderate changes, use the Canary deployment strategy:

1. **Initial Deployment**
   - Deploy new version to a subset of infrastructure (10%)
   - Direct a small percentage of traffic to the new version
   - Monitor performance and errors

2. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Increase traffic to new version in increments (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   - Monitor key metrics at each stage
   - Rollback if issues detected

3. **Completion**
   - Direct 100% of traffic to new version
   - Decommission old version
   - Document deployment metrics

### Rolling Update

For minor releases or small changes, use the Rolling Update strategy:

1. **Gradual Replacement**
   - Update services one by one
   - Verify health of each service before proceeding
   - Maintain minimum availability during update

2. **Verification**
   - Check service health after each update
   - Verify service interactions
   - Monitor performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Service Startup Failures**
   - Check service logs for errors
   - Verify service dependencies
   - Check configuration values
   - Verify resource allocation

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check database credentials
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check connection pool configuration
   - Verify database server health

3. **API Gateway Issues**
   - Check API gateway logs
   - Verify route configurations
   - Check authentication services
   - Verify SSL certificate configuration
