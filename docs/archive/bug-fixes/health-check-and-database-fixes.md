# Health Check and Database Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address issues with the health check system and database schema.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Async Health Check Functions

**Issue**: The health check system in the API Gateway service couldn't handle async health check functions. When an async health check function was registered, the system would try to call it directly and unpack the result, but since the function is async, it would return a coroutine object, not a tuple.

**Solution**:
- Modified `shared/utils/src/monitoring/health.py` to handle async health check functions using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()` to detect async functions and `await` them appropriately.
- Updated `shared/utils/src/monitoring/middleware/fastapi.py` to properly handle the now-async `check_health` function.
- Updated `services/api-gateway/src/main.py` to use the async health check functions.

**Impact**: The health check system can now handle both sync and async health check functions, making it more flexible and robust.

### 2. Missing Database Tables

**Issue**: The `project_state` table was missing from the database, causing errors when trying to create projects.

**Solution**:
- Ran the `init.sql` script to create the missing tables, including the `project_state` table.
- Restarted the project-coordinator service to pick up the changes.

**Impact**: The project creation functionality now works correctly, and the database schema is complete.

## Testing

The following tests were performed to verify the fixes:

1. **Health Check Endpoints**:
   - `/health` endpoint returns a 200 OK response with detailed health information.
   - `/api/health` endpoint returns a 200 OK response with basic health information.

2. **Project Creation**:
   - Successfully created a project via the `/projects/` endpoint.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Async/Sync Compatibility**: When designing systems that can use both sync and async functions, it's important to detect the function type and handle it appropriately.

2. **Database Schema Management**: Ensure that all required tables are created before starting services that depend on them. Consider using a more robust migration system to manage database schema changes.

3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more informative error messages when issues like missing tables are encountered.

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Schema Verification**: Implement a system to verify that all required tables exist before starting services.

2. **Centralized Migration Management**: Consider using a centralized migration management system to ensure that all services have a consistent view of the database schema.

3. **Health Check Enhancements**: Enhance the health check system to provide more detailed information about the health of the system, including database schema verification.
