   - Application-level metrics (business KPIs, user activity)
   - Error and exception tracking

2. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Structured logging across all services
   - Centralized log collection and storage
   - Log analysis and search capabilities

3. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Cross-service request tracing
   - Performance bottleneck identification
   - Error correlation

4. **Health Checks**
   - Component health monitoring
   - Dependency health checks
   - Standardized health check API

5. **Alerting System**
   - Threshold-based alerts
   - Anomaly detection
   - Alert management and escalation

6. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Deployment verification
   - Canary deployments with automatic rollback
   - Performance regression testing

7. **Visualization Dashboard**
   - Service health overview
   - Metrics visualization
   - Log exploration
   - Alert management

## Implementation Details

### Core Monitoring Components

The monitoring system is implemented as a set of Python modules in the `shared/utils/src/monitoring` directory:

- `metrics.py`: Metrics collection and reporting system
- `logging.py`: Structured logging system with context propagation
- `tracing.py`: Distributed tracing system for cross-service request tracking
- `health.py`: Health check system for service and dependency health monitoring
- `alerts.py`: Alerting system for detecting and managing incidents

### Framework Integration

The monitoring system includes middleware for different web frameworks:

- `middleware/fastapi.py`: FastAPI middleware for request tracking, metrics, and tracing
- `middleware/flask.py`: Flask middleware for the same functionality

### Metrics Exporters

The system includes exporters for different monitoring backends:

- `exporters/prometheus.py`: Exporter for Prometheus metrics format

### CI/CD Integration

The monitoring system integrates with the CI/CD pipeline:

- `ci_cd/deployment_verification.py`: Tools for verifying deployment health
- `.github/workflows/templates/monitoring.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow template for monitoring deployments

### Web Dashboard

The monitoring system includes a web dashboard for visualization:

- `services/web-dashboard/app/templates/monitoring/index.html`: Main dashboard UI
- `services/web-dashboard/app/templates/monitoring/service_detail.html`: Service detail UI
- `services/web-dashboard/app/routes/monitoring.py`: Dashboard routes and controllers

## Service Integration

To integrate the monitoring system with a service, follow these steps:

1. Add dependencies to your service's `requirements.txt`:

```
requests>=2.28.0
prometheus-client>=0.15.0
```

2. Import and set up the monitoring components in your service's startup code:

For FastAPI services:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from shared.utils.src.monitoring.middleware.fastapi import setup_monitoring
from shared.utils.src.monitoring.metrics import configure_metrics, MetricsBackend
from shared.utils.src.monitoring.logging import configure_logging

# Configure logging
configure_logging(
    level="INFO",
    json_format=True,
    log_to_console=True,
    service_name="your-service-name",
)

# Configure metrics
configure_metrics(
    backend=MetricsBackend.PROMETHEUS,
    prefix="berrys_agents",
    default_tags={"service": "your-service-name"},
)

app = FastAPI()

# Set up monitoring middleware
setup_monitoring(app, service_name="your-service-name")
```

For Flask services:

```python
from flask import Flask
from shared.utils.src.monitoring.middleware.flask import setup_monitoring
from shared.utils.src.monitoring.metrics import configure_metrics, MetricsBackend
from shared.utils.src.monitoring.logging import configure_logging

# Configure logging
configure_logging(
    level="INFO",
    json_format=True,
    log_to_console=True,
    service_name="your-service-name",
)

# Configure metrics
configure_metrics(
    backend=MetricsBackend.PROMETHEUS,
    prefix="berrys_agents",
    default_tags={"service": "your-service-name"},
)

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set up monitoring middleware
setup_monitoring(app, service_name="your-service-name")
```

3. Register health checks for your service:

```python
from shared.utils.src.monitoring.health import register_health_check

@register_health_check("database")
async def check_database_connection():
    # Check if database is accessible
    is_healthy = await check_db_connection()
    return is_healthy, "Database connection is healthy" if is_healthy else "Database connection failed"
```

4. Add monitoring to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
jobs:
  # ... other jobs

  monitor-deployment:
    needs: deploy
    uses: ./.github/workflows/templates/monitoring.yml
    with:
      service_name: your-service-name
      environment: development
      deploy_url: https://your-service-url
      verify_health: true
      verify_metrics: true
      verify_performance: true
```

    default_tags={                      # Tags to add to all metrics
        "environment": "production",
        "service": "api-gateway"

configure_tracing(
    service_name="api-gateway",         # Service name for traces
    sample_rate=0.1,                    # Sampling rate (0.0-1.0)
    exporter="jaeger",                  # Exporter type (jaeger, zipkin, etc.)
    exporter_endpoint="localhost:14268" # Exporter endpoint

```

### Health Check Configuration

```python
configure_health_checks(
    include_dependencies=True,          # Include dependency health checks
    cache_ttl=60,                       # Cache health check results for 60 seconds
)

    delivery_method="slack",            # Alert delivery method (slack, email, etc.)
    delivery_config={                   # Delivery configuration
        "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/...",
        "channel": "#alerts"
    },
    throttle_period=300,                # Throttle similar alerts for 5 minutes
)
```
