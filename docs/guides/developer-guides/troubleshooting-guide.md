This guide provides comprehensive troubleshooting strategies for developers and agents working on the Berrys_AgentsV2 platform. It includes approaches for identifying, diagnosing, and resolving common issues that may arise during development, testing, and deployment.

## 1. General Troubleshooting Approach

### 1.1 Systematic Problem Isolation

1. **Define the issue precisely**
   - Identify the exact error message or unexpected behavior
   - Document when and where it occurs
   - Note any recent changes that might have triggered it

2. **Isolate the problem**
   - Determine which component or service is exhibiting the issue
   - Test individual components in isolation if possible
   - Use process of elimination to narrow down potential causes

3. **Reproduce the issue**
   - Create a minimal reproduction case
   - Document the steps to consistently reproduce the behavior
   - Identify any environmental factors that influence the issue

4. **Check logs and monitoring**
   - Review service logs for errors or warnings
   - Check system monitoring for resource constraints
   - Look for timing or sequence issues in distributed operations

### 1.2 Holistic Error Analysis

When encountering errors from a specific package or module:

1. **Pattern recognition**
   - Review all similar code patterns throughout the project
   - Look for the same error pattern in other services or components
   - Search for similar issues in project documentation or commit history

2. **Common structural issues**
   - Check for incorrect module aliasing
   - Look for improper import statements, particularly for modules above the parent-level of a package
   - Verify consistent naming conventions across related components

3. **Cross-service pattern matching**
   - Identify related services that might have similar implementations
   - Check for consistent patterns in dependency management
   - Review service interactions for consistency

## 2. Service Management and Diagnostics

### 2.1 Service Restart and Log Analysis

When debugging service issues:

1. **Request service restart and logs**
   - Ask the user to restart the affected service:
     ```
     Please run `docker-compose restart [service-name]` and share the logs with me
     ```
   - Request logs for the specific service:
     ```
     Please run `docker-compose logs --tail=100 [service-name]` and share the output
     ```
   - For specific errors, request filtered logs:
     ```
     Please run `docker-compose logs [service-name] | grep "error"` and share the results
     ```

2. **Analyze startup sequence**
   - Look for initialization errors during service startup
   - Check for dependency issues during bootstrapping
   - Verify configuration loading and validation

3. **Check related services**
   - Identify services that interact with the problematic one
   - Request logs from these services to check for communication issues
   - Look for timing or sequence issues in cross-service communication

### 2.2 Environment and Configuration Verification

1. **Environment variables**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set correctly
   - Check for inconsistencies between development and production configurations
   - Ensure sensitive values are properly protected and accessed
