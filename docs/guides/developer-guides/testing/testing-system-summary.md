- Configuration fixtures for standardized test configuration
- Test data generators for creating test data

### Schema Validation

The schema validation utilities provide:

- Extract schema definitions from databases
- Compare schema between databases and models
- Detect schema drift between environments
- Format schema differences for human readability

### Contract Testing

The contract testing utilities provide:

- Define and validate service contracts
- Verify requests and responses conform to contracts
- Generate contract tests from contract definitions
- Test API client implementations against contracts

### Integration Testing

The integration testing utilities provide:

- Spin up service instances for testing
- Mock external services for isolated integration tests
- Harness for orchestrating multi-service tests
- Retry mechanism for handling flaky service interactions

### Performance Testing

The performance testing utilities provide:

- Benchmark function performance
- Load test service endpoints
- Track performance metrics
- Detect performance regressions

### Coverage Reporting

The coverage reporting utilities provide:

- Collect test coverage data
- Generate coverage reports in multiple formats
- Create coverage badges for display in documentation
- Track coverage trends over time

## Usage Instructions

### Running Tests

To run all tests for a service:

```bash
cd services/[service-name]
python -m pytest
```

To run tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html:coverage_html --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml
```

### Using the Testing Framework

1. **Database Tests**:
   ```python
   from shared.utils.src.testing.database import test_database_session
   
   def test_database_operation():
       with test_database_session() as session:
           # Test database operations
           pass
   ```

2. **Schema Validation**:
   ```python
   from shared.utils.src.testing.schema import SchemaValidator
   
   def test_schema(test_db):
       validator = SchemaValidator(test_db)
       differences = validator.compare_schema_with_models(Base)
       assert not differences['missing_tables']
   ```

3. **Contract Tests**:
   ```python
   from shared.utils.src.testing.contract import ContractVerifier
   
   def test_contract(contract_verifier):
       validated = contract_verifier.verify_request(
           consumer_name="service-a",
           provider_name="service-b",
           endpoint="/api/resource",
           method="GET",
           request_data={}
       )
       assert validated is not None
   ```

4. **Integration Tests**:
   ```python
   from shared.utils.src.testing.integration import integration_test
   
   @integration_test(services=["service-a"], mock_services=["service-b"])
   async def test_integration(harness, mock_services):
       service_a = harness.get_service("service-a")
       response = service_a.get("/api/resource")
       assert response.status_code == 200
   ```

5. **Performance Tests**:
   ```python
   from shared.utils.src.testing.performance import benchmark
   
   @benchmark(iterations=100, warmup=5)
   def test_performance():
       # Code to benchmark
       return result
   ```

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements to the testing system include:

1. **Visual Test Reports**: Enhanced visualization of test results
2. **Cross-Service Test Coverage**: Combined coverage reports across services
3. **Test Data Management**: Centralized management of test data
4. **Mutation Testing**: Test suite quality evaluation through mutation testing
5. **Property-Based Testing**: Generate test cases from property specifications
6. **Test Environment Management**: Improved containerized test environment management

## Conclusion

The Advanced Testing and Verification System provides a robust foundation for ensuring the quality and reliability of the Berrys_AgentsV2 platform. By standardizing testing patterns and providing reusable utilities, the system makes it easier to write comprehensive tests and maintain high quality standards across the platform.
