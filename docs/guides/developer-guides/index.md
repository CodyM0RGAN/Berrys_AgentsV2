## Development Principles

When developing for Berrys_AgentsV2, adhere to these core principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each service should have a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Microservice Architecture**: Services should be independent and loosely coupled
3. **API-First Design**: Define clear API contracts before implementation
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before or alongside code
5. **Documentation**: Document all public APIs and interfaces
6. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and practices
7. **Modularity**: Design for extensibility and reusability
