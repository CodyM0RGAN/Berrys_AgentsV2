## Project Creation and Planning

The project creation and planning process establishes the foundation for execution:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant WD as Web Dashboard
    participant PC as Project Coordinator
    participant PS as Planning System
    
    User->>WD: Create Project Request
    Note over User,WD: Includes project description, objectives, and requirements
    
    WD->>PC: Forward Project Request
    PC->>PC: Create Project Record
    PC->>PS: Request Project Planning
    
    PS->>PS: Generate Project Plan
    PS->>PS: Create Tasks and Dependencies
    PS->>PS: Assign Roles
    
    PS->>PC: Return Project Plan
    PC->>WD: Project Created with Plan
    WD->>User: Display Project Details
```

### Planning Process Details

1. **Project Definition**
   - User provides project description, objectives, and requirements
   - Web Dashboard formats and validates the input
   - Project Coordinator creates a new project record

2. **Strategic Planning**
   - Planning System analyzes project requirements
   - High-level goals and milestones are established
   - Project methodology is selected based on requirements

3. **Tactical Planning**
   - Project is broken down into tasks
   - Task dependencies are identified
   - Resource requirements are estimated
   - Timeline is projected

4. **Role Definition**
   - Required agent roles are identified
   - Skills and capabilities for each role are defined
   - Planning System determines specializations needed

## Agent Team Assembly

Once planning is complete, a team of agents is assembled:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PC as Project Coordinator
    participant PS as Planning System
    participant AO as Agent Orchestrator
    participant AGE as Agent Generation Engine
    
    PS->>PC: Provide Role Requirements
    PC->>AO: Request Agent Team
    
    loop For Each Role
        AO->>AGE: Request Agent Creation
        AGE->>AGE: Create Specialized Agent
        AGE->>AO: Return Agent
    end
    
    AO->>AO: Form Agent Team
    AO->>PC: Return Agent Team
    PC->>PS: Assign Agents to Project Plan
```

### Team Assembly Steps

1. **Role Analysis**
   - Planning System defines required roles based on project plan
   - Each role has specific skill requirements and specializations

2. **Agent Creation**
   - Agent Orchestrator requests agent creation from Agent Generation Engine
   - Agent templates are selected based on role requirements
   - Agents are specialized for their specific roles
   - Agents are initialized with project context

3. **Team Formation**
   - Agents are organized into a team structure
   - Team hierarchy is established if needed
   - Communication channels are set up
   - Collaboration patterns are configured

## Task Assignment and Execution

With the team assembled, task execution begins:

    PS->>AO: Assign Initial Tasks
    
    loop Until Project Completion
        AO->>Agents: Distribute Tasks
        
        loop For Each Task
            Agents->>MO: Execute Reasoning
            
            opt Tool Required
                Agents->>TI: Use External Tool
                TI->>Agents: Tool Results
            end
            
            Agents->>Agents: Process Results
            Agents->>AO: Report Task Completion
        end
        
        AO->>PS: Update Task Status
        PS->>PS: Update Project Plan
        PS->>AO: Assign Next Tasks
    end
    
    PS->>PC: Project Execution Complete
```

### Task Execution Details

1. **Task Distribution**
   - Planning System assigns initial tasks based on dependencies
   - Agent Orchestrator distributes tasks to appropriate agents
   - Agents receive task context and requirements

2. **Task Execution**
   - Agents process their assigned tasks
   - Model Orchestration provides reasoning capabilities
   - Tool Integration supplies access to external tools
   - Agents collaborate when needed through Agent Communication Hub

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Agents report task completion to Agent Orchestrator
   - Planning System updates project plan based on progress
   - New tasks are assigned as dependencies are satisfied

## Review and Revision

Project outputs are reviewed and may require revision:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant WD as Web Dashboard
    participant PC as Project Coordinator
    participant PS as Planning System
    
    PC->>WD: Provide Project Outputs
    WD->>User: Present for Review
    
    alt Revision Needed
        User->>WD: Request Revisions
        WD->>PC: Forward Revision Request
        PC->>PS: Update Project Requirements
        PS->>PS: Revise Project Plan
        PS->>PC: Return Revised Plan
