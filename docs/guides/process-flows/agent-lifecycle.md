## Overview

This document describes the lifecycle of agents in the Berrys_AgentsV2 platform. It covers the creation, initialization, specialization, operation, and termination of agents, including state transitions and interaction patterns.

## Agent Lifecycle States

Agents in the Berrys_AgentsV2 platform go through several defined states:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Creating
    Creating --> Initializing
    Initializing --> Ready
    Ready --> Active
    Active --> Ready
    Active --> Paused
    Paused --> Active
    Paused --> Ready
    Ready --> Terminating
    Active --> Terminating
    Paused --> Terminating
    Terminating --> [*]
    
    Creating: Initial creation state
    Initializing: Loading template and configuring
    Ready: Available for task assignment
    Active: Currently executing task(s)
    Paused: Temporarily suspended
    Terminating: Cleaning up resources
```

### State Definitions

| State | Description | Allowed Transitions |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Creating | Agent record is being created | Initializing |
| Initializing | Agent is loading template, configuring capabilities | Ready |
| Ready | Agent is available for task assignment | Active, Terminating |
| Active | Agent is executing one or more tasks | Ready, Paused, Terminating |
| Paused | Agent execution is temporarily suspended | Active, Ready, Terminating |
| Terminating | Agent is cleaning up resources and preparing to terminate | (Terminal state) |

## Agent Creation and Initialization

The process of creating and initializing an agent:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UC as User/Client
    participant AO as Agent Orchestrator
    participant AT as Agent Templates
    participant AS as Agent Specialization
    participant MO as Model Orchestration
    
    UC->>AO: Create Agent Request
    AO->>AO: Validate Request
    AO->>AT: Get Template
    AT->>AO: Return Template
    
    AO->>AO: Create Agent Record (Creating)
    
    AO->>AO: Update Agent State (Initializing)
    AO->>AS: Apply Specializations
    AS->>AO: Return Configured Agent
    
    AO->>MO: Initialize Agent Model
    MO->>MO: Select Model
    MO->>MO: Configure Model
    MO->>AO: Return Initialization Results
    
    AO->>AO: Update Agent State (Ready)
    AO->>UC: Return Created Agent
```

### Creation Parameters

Agents are created with several key parameters:

```json
{
  "name": "Data Analysis Agent",
  "template_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "description": "Agent specialized for data analysis tasks",
  "specializations": ["data_analysis", "visualization"],
  "configuration": {
    "max_concurrent_tasks": 3,
    "preferred_model": "deepseek-r1:8b"
  }
}
```

### Agent Templates

Templates provide base capabilities for agents:

| Template | Purpose | Base Capabilities |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| General Purpose | Multi-domain tasks | Text processing, basic reasoning |
| Data Specialist | Data-focused tasks | Data analysis, visualization, ETL |
| Research Assistant | Information gathering | Web search, document analysis, summarization |
| Task Coordinator | Manage other agents | Task breakdown, delegation, monitoring |
| Code Assistant | Software development | Code generation, review, testing |

### Agent Specialization

Once created from a template, agents can be specialized with additional capabilities:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Base Agent Template] --> B[Apply Specializations]
    B --> C[Specialize Context]
    B --> D[Specialize Tools]
    B --> E[Specialize Knowledge]
    C --> F[Specialized Agent]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    style A fill:#d0e0ff,stroke:#0066cc
    style B fill:#ffe0d0,stroke:#cc6600
    style C fill:#ffe0d0,stroke:#cc6600
    style D fill:#ffe0d0,stroke:#cc6600
    style E fill:#ffe0d0,stroke:#cc6600
    style F fill:#d0ffd0,stroke:#00cc00
```

Specialization approaches:
- **Context specialization**: Providing domain-specific instructions
- **Tool specialization**: Granting access to specific tools
- **Knowledge specialization**: Loading domain-specific knowledge
- **Behavior specialization**: Configuring response patterns and preferences

## Agent Task Assignment

The process of assigning a task to an agent:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PS as Planning System
    participant AO as Agent Orchestrator
    participant Agent as Agent
    
    PS->>AO: Assign Task Request
    AO->>AO: Locate Agent
    AO->>AO: Check Agent State
    
    alt Agent Not Ready
        AO->>PS: Rejection (Agent Not Ready)
    else Agent Ready
        AO->>Agent: Update State (Ready â†’ Active)
        AO->>Agent: Assign Task
        Agent->>AO: Acknowledge Assignment
        AO->>PS: Assignment Confirmation
    end
```

### Task Context

When assigned a task, agents receive context:

```json
{
  "task_id": "a8b7c6d5-e4f3-4a2b-8c7d-6e5f4a3b2c1d",
  "title": "Analyze Customer Data",
  "description": "Analyze the customer dataset for purchasing patterns and create visualizations",
  "priority": "high",
  "deadline": "2025-03-29T08:00:00Z",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "customer_data.csv",
      "location": "s3://data-bucket/customer_data.csv",
      "type": "dataset"
    }
  ],
  "expected_outputs": [
    {
      "name": "analysis_report.md",
      "description": "Markdown report with findings",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "name": "visualizations.pdf",
      "description": "PDF with key visualizations",
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "constraints": {
    "max_execution_time_minutes": 30
  }
}
```

## Agent Task Execution

During task execution, agents progress through several phases:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Received] --> B[Planning Phase]
    B --> C[Execution Phase]
    C --> D[Tool Usage Phase]
    D --> E[Result Compilation Phase]
    E --> F[Task Completion]
    
    subgraph "Planning Phase"
        B1[Analyze Requirements]
        B2[Create Execution Plan]
        B3[Identify Resource Needs]
        B1 --> B2 --> B3
    end
    
    subgraph "Execution Phase"
        C1[Process Inputs]
        C2[Execute Core Logic]
        C3[Generate Interim Results]
        C1 --> C2 --> C3
    end
    
    subgraph "Tool Usage Phase"
        D1[Select Tools]
        D2[Configure Tool Parameters]
        D3[Execute Tools]
        D4[Process Tool Results]
        D1 --> D2 --> D3 --> D4
    end
    
    subgraph "Result Compilation Phase"
        E1[Aggregate Results]
        E2[Format Outputs]
        E3[Validate Against Requirements]
        E1 --> E2 --> E3
    end
    
    style A fill:#d0e0ff,stroke:#0066cc
    style B fill:#ffe0d0,stroke:#cc6600
    style C fill:#ffe0d0,stroke:#cc6600
    style D fill:#ffe0d0,stroke:#cc6600
    style E fill:#ffe0d0,stroke:#cc6600
    style F fill:#d0ffd0,stroke:#00cc00
```

### Model Interactions

During task execution, agents interact with models:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Agent
    participant MO as Model Orchestration
    participant Models as External Models
    
    Agent->>MO: Model Execution Request
    MO->>MO: Select Appropriate Model
    MO->>MO: Format Prompt/Request
    MO->>Models: Send Model Request
    Models->>MO: Model Response
    MO->>MO: Process Response
    MO->>Agent: Return Processed Results
```

### Tool Usage

Agents use external tools through the Tool Integration service:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Agent
    participant TI as Tool Integration
    participant Tools as External Tools
    
    Agent->>TI: Tool Execution Request
    TI->>TI: Validate Request & Permissions
    TI->>TI: Prepare Tool Parameters
    TI->>Tools: Execute Tool
    Tools->>TI: Tool Results
    TI->>TI: Process & Format Results
    TI->>Agent: Return Processed Results
```

## Agent Collaboration

Agents can collaborate to accomplish complex tasks:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Coordinator as Coordinator Agent
    participant Worker1 as Worker Agent 1
    participant Worker2 as Worker Agent 2
    participant AO as Agent Orchestrator
    participant ACH as Agent Communication Hub
    
    Coordinator->>Coordinator: Decompose Task
    Coordinator->>AO: Request Worker Agents
    AO->>Coordinator: Return Worker Agents
    
    Coordinator->>ACH: Send Subtask to Worker1
    ACH->>Worker1: Deliver Subtask
    Worker1->>Worker1: Process Subtask
    
    Coordinator->>ACH: Send Subtask to Worker2
    ACH->>Worker2: Deliver Subtask
    Worker2->>Worker2: Process Subtask
    
    Worker1->>ACH: Send Results
    ACH->>Coordinator: Deliver Results
    
    Worker2->>ACH: Send Results
    ACH->>Coordinator: Deliver Results
    
    Coordinator->>Coordinator: Aggregate Results
```

### Collaboration Patterns

The platform supports several collaboration patterns:

| Pattern | Description | Use Cases |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchical | Manager-worker hierarchy | Complex task decomposition, specialized subtasks |
| Peer-to-Peer | Equal agents working together | Collaborative problem-solving, consensus building |
| Assembly Line | Sequential task processing | Multi-stage workflows, data processing pipelines |
| Specialist Network | Agents with specific domains | Multidisciplinary projects, diverse expertise needs |

## Agent State Transitions

Agents maintain a detailed state history:

```sql
-- Example state history record
INSERT INTO agent_state_history (
    agent_id, 
    previous_state, 
    new_state, 
    transition_reason,
    created_at
) VALUES (
    'f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479',
    'ready',
    'active',
    'Task assignment: a8b7c6d5-e4f3-4a2b-8c7d-6e5f4a3b2c1d',
    '2025-03-29T05:45:10.123456Z'
);
```

### State Transition Rules

State transitions follow specific rules:

| Current State | Valid Next States | Transition Triggers |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Creating | Initializing | Initial record creation complete |
| Initializing | Ready | Template loaded, specializations applied |
| Ready | Active | Task assignment |
| Ready | Terminating | Manual termination, resource reclamation |
| Active | Ready | Task completion |
| Active | Paused | Manual pause, resource constraints |
| Active | Terminating | Manual termination, critical error |
| Paused | Active | Manual resume |
| Paused | Ready | Task cancellation |
| Paused | Terminating | Manual termination, timeout |

## Agent Termination

The process of terminating an agent:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client
    participant AO as Agent Orchestrator
    participant Agent as Agent
    participant MO as Model Orchestration
    participant DB as Database
    
    Client->>AO: Terminate Agent Request
    AO->>Agent: Update State (Current â†’ Terminating)
    
    alt Agent Has Active Tasks
        AO->>AO: Cancel Active Tasks
        AO->>AO: Notify Task Owners
    end
    
    AO->>MO: Release Model Resources
    AO->>Agent: Finalize Agent State
    AO->>DB: Archive Agent Data
    AO->>DB: Update Agent Record (Terminated)
    AO->>Client: Confirm Termination
```

### Termination Reasons

Agents may be terminated for several reasons:

- **Task completion**: Agent is no longer needed
- **Resource optimization**: Freeing up system resources
- **Agent replacement**: Being replaced by a more appropriate agent
- **Error condition**: Unrecoverable errors in agent operation
- **Security concerns**: Detected anomalous behavior
- **Project completion**: End of the project

## Performance Metrics

Agents are monitored using several key metrics:

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Task Completion Rate | Percentage of successfully completed tasks | >95% |
| Response Time | Time to start processing a task | <1 second |
| Execution Time | Average time to complete tasks | Task-dependent |
| Model Token Usage | Number of tokens consumed | Optimized for task |
| Tool Usage Efficiency | Appropriate selection and use of tools | >90% appropriate use |
| Collaboration Success | Successful interactions with other agents | >95% |
