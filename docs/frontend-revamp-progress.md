## Current Status

The frontend framework is now set up with all the necessary infrastructure for feature implementation. This includes:

- A complete routing structure with protected routes
- Redux state management for all major data domains
- API integration with authentication
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Basic UI components and layout
- Notifications and Approvals system implemented
- Placeholder pages for remaining routes

The application is in a working state with core functionality implemented. The Dashboard, Notifications and Approvals pages demonstrate the integration of all components (Redux, API, WebSocket) and can serve as references for implementing other pages.

## Important Information

### Environment Variables

The frontend requires the following environment variables:

- `VITE_API_URL`: URL for the backend API (default: http://localhost:8080/api)
- `VITE_WS_URL`: URL for the WebSocket server (default: http://localhost:8080)

These should be defined in a `.env` file in the frontend directory. A `.env.example` file is provided as a template.

### Authentication

Authentication is handled using JWT tokens stored in localStorage. The `authSlice.js` manages the authentication state, and the API service automatically includes the token in requests.

### WebSocket Integration

The WebSocket service connects to the backend when the user is authenticated and subscribes to events based on the user's permissions. Events from the backend are processed by the `handleWebSocketEvent` utility and dispatched to the appropriate Redux slices.

### Lazy Loading

React's `lazy` and `Suspense` are used for code splitting. This improves initial load time by only loading the code needed for the current route.

## Getting Started for New Developers

1. Review the [Frontend Revamp Developer Guide](docs/guides/developer-guides/frontend-revamp.md) for an overview of the architecture and implementation
2. Set up the development environment following the instructions in [Frontend README](frontend/README.md)
3. Explore the codebase, starting with `App.jsx` to understand the routing structure
4. Run the application and navigate through the existing pages
5. Pick a feature from the next milestone and start implementation

## Tips for Implementation

- Use the Dashboard page as a reference for integrating Redux, API, and WebSocket
- Follow the patterns established in the existing code for consistency
- Use the custom hooks (`useApi`, `useWebSocket`) for API calls and WebSocket integration
- Implement real-time updates for all features using the WebSocket service
- Add comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- Write tests for all new components and functionality

## Conclusion

The frontend revamp is well underway with a solid foundation in place. The next steps involve building out the specific feature pages and functionality, followed by testing and optimization. With the infrastructure already in place, this should be a straightforward process following the patterns established in the existing code.
