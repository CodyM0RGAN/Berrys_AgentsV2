# Next Milestone: Frontend Feature Implementation

## Overview

The React frontend framework for Berry's Agents V2 has been successfully set up with all the necessary infrastructure. The next milestone involves implementing the specific feature pages and functionality to create a fully functional web dashboard.

## Current Status

The frontend framework includes:
- Complete routing structure with protected routes
- Redux state management for all major data domains
- API integration with authentication
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Basic UI components and layout

**Completed Features:**
- Dashboard page with stats and real-time updates
- Projects feature (list and detail pages) with CRUD operations and real-time updates
- Chat interface for Berry with real-time messaging and markdown support
- Notifications & Approvals system with real-time updates and workflow management

The Dashboard page and Projects feature are fully implemented and demonstrate the integration of all components (Redux, API, WebSocket). They can serve as a reference for implementing other pages.

For detailed information on the implementation progress, see [Frontend Milestone Progress](docs/frontend-milestone-progress.md).

## Your Task

Your task is to implement the remaining features:


### 2. System Architecture Page

- **Architecture Visualization**
   - Create a visual representation of the system architecture
   - Show service dependencies and connections
   - Implement real-time status indicators for services

- **System Health Monitoring**
   - Implement monitoring for system health metrics
   - Create visualizations for system performance
   - Add alerts for system issues

## Getting Started

1. Review the following documentation:
   - [Frontend Revamp Progress](frontend-revamp-progress.md): Overview of completed work and next steps
   - [Frontend Revamp Developer Guide](./guides/developer-guides/frontend-revamp.md): Architecture and implementation details
   - [Frontend README](frontend/README.md): Setup instructions
   - [Chat Implementation Guide](./archive/service-development/chat-implementation.md): Details about the chat functionality

2. Set up the development environment:
   - Clone the repository
   - Install dependencies with `npm install`
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
   - Start the development server with `npm run dev`

3. Explore the existing codebase:
   - Start with `App.jsx` to understand the routing structure
   - Look at the Dashboard page for an example of a fully implemented page
   - Examine the Redux slices, especially `projectsSlice.js`
   - Review the API service and WebSocket integration

## Implementation Guidelines

### Projects Feature Implementation

1. Create a new file `frontend/src/pages/Projects.jsx` (replacing the placeholder)
2. Implement a table or grid view of projects with the following features:
   - Sorting by name, status, creation date
   - Filtering by status, owner, tags
   - Pagination
   - Search functionality
3. Add a "Create Project" button that opens a modal or navigates to a creation form
4. Use the `useApi` hook to fetch projects from the API
5. Use the `useWebSocket` hook to subscribe to project events for real-time updates
6. Connect to the Redux store to access and update project data

### Chat Interface Implementation

1. Evaluate and install the recommended chat UI libraries:
   - **Primary Option**: NLUX - Specifically designed for AI chatbots with LLM integration
   - **Alternative Option**: Chat UI Kit React by Chatscope - Comprehensive and customizable
   - See detailed evaluation in [Chat UI Library Evaluation](./guides/developer-guides/chat-ui-library-evaluation.md)

2. Create a new component `frontend/src/components/Chat/ChatWindow.jsx` using the selected library
3. Implement the chat UI with the following features:
   - Message list with user and bot messages
   - Message input with send button
   - Typing indicator
   - Message status indicators
4. Create a Redux slice for chat state management
5. Implement API integration for sending and receiving messages
6. Use WebSocket for real-time message updates
7. Add support for markdown rendering in chat messages

### Notifications & Approvals Implementation

1. Create a new component `frontend/src/components/Notifications/NotificationsDropdown.jsx`
2. Implement the notifications UI with the following features:
   - List of notifications with different types
   - Mark as read functionality
   - Clear all functionality
3. Create a Redux slice for notifications state management
4. Implement API integration for fetching notifications
5. Use WebSocket for real-time notification updates
6. Add approval request components with accept/reject functionality

### System Architecture Page Implementation

1. Create a new file `frontend/src/pages/SystemArchitecture.jsx`
2. Implement a visual representation of the system architecture using:
   - SVG or Canvas for rendering
   - Interactive elements for service details
   - Status indicators for service health
3. Add system health monitoring with:
   - Charts for performance metrics
   - Alerts for system issues
   - Historical data viewing
4. Implement API integration for fetching system status
5. Use WebSocket for real-time status updates
