## Communication Patterns

The system uses the following communication patterns:

1. **REST API**: For synchronous communication between the web dashboard and API gateway.
   - HTTP/JSON-based communication
   - Request-response pattern
   - Stateless interactions

2. **Event-based**: For asynchronous communication between services using Redis pub/sub.
   - Publish-subscribe pattern
   - Asynchronous processing
   - Loose coupling between services

3. **Command-based**: For request-response patterns between services.
   - Command pattern
   - Direct service-to-service communication
   - Synchronous or asynchronous execution

## Model Orchestration Strategy

The Model Orchestration & Delegation system intelligently routes requests to the most appropriate AI model based on:

1. **Task Classification**: Categorizes requests by complexity and requirements.
   - Analyzes request content
   - Determines task type
   - Identifies specific requirements

2. **Capability Matching**: Matches task requirements with model capabilities.

   - Matches requirements to capabilities
   - Considers model strengths and weaknesses

3. **Cost Optimization**: Balances cost and performance considerations.

   - Optimizes for cost-effectiveness
   - Respects budget constraints

4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provides graceful degradation when preferred models are unavailable.
   - Implements fallback strategies
   - Handles model unavailability
   - Ensures service continuity

## Human-in-the-Loop Protocol

The Human-in-the-Loop system determines when human intervention is required:

1. **Approval Workflows**: For critical decisions that require human approval.

   - Routes approval requests to appropriate humans
   - Tracks approval status

2. **Feedback Collection**: For gathering human feedback on system outputs.
   - Collects feedback on system outputs
   - Incorporates feedback into future decisions
   - Improves system performance over time

3. **Clarification Requests**: For resolving ambiguities in requirements.
   - Identifies ambiguous requirements
   - Formulates clarification questions
   - Processes clarification responses

4. **Notifications**: For keeping humans informed of important events.
   - Generates notifications for important events

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for API access.
   - Secure token generation and validation
   - Token expiration and renewal
   - Role-based access control

2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different operations.
   - Fine-grained permission system
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-level permissions

3. **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   - TLS for data in transit
   - Database encryption for data at rest
   - Secure credential storage

4. **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and protection against common attacks.
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Input validation to prevent injection attacks
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be scaled independently based on load.
   - Stateless service design
   - Container orchestration
   - Load balancing

2. **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL can be scaled using replication and sharding.
   - Read replicas for scaling reads
   - Sharding for scaling writes
   - Connection pooling

3. **Caching**: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data.
   - Distributed caching
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - Optimized cache usage

4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks are processed asynchronously.
   - Message queues for task distribution
   - Background workers for processing
   - Task prioritization
