## Overview

Berrys_AgentsV2 is a comprehensive multi-agent orchestration platform designed to enable intelligent agents to collaborate on complex tasks. The platform provides scalable, resilient infrastructure for deploying, managing, and coordinating AI agents across various domains and use cases.

## Core Features

- **Agent Orchestration**: Create, deploy, and manage AI agents
- **Task Planning**: Decompose complex tasks and coordinate execution
- **Model Integration**: Connect to various AI models with standardized interfaces
- **Tool Integration**: Provide agents with access to external tools and APIs
- **Service Integration**: Coordinate workflows across multiple services
- **Web Dashboard**: Visualize and manage platform activities

## Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with specialized services:
