# Tool Integration Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts for the Tool Integration service.

## Migration Scripts

- `tool_integration_standardization.py`: Standardizes the Tool Integration service by renaming tables from plural to singular, converting lowercase enum values to uppercase, and adding check constraints for enum values.

## Running Migrations

To apply migrations, use the following command:

```bash
cd services/tool-integration
alembic upgrade head
```

To create a new migration, use the following command:

```bash
cd services/tool-integration
alembic revision -m "description of the migration"
```

## Migration Guidelines

1. Always create a migration script for database schema changes
2. Test migrations on a development database before applying to production
3. Include both upgrade and downgrade functions in migration scripts
4. Document the purpose of each migration script
5. Use idempotent operations where possible to avoid errors if a migration is run multiple times
