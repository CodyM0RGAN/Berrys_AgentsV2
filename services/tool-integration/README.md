# Tool Integration Service

The Tool Integration Service is responsible for discovering, evaluating, integrating, and executing tools for agents in the system. It serves as a central point for managing all tool-related operations, providing a unified interface for agents to use external tools.

## Architecture

The service follows a layered architecture with a clean separation of concerns and leverages the Facade pattern to provide a simplified interface to clients:

### Core Components

1. **Tool Service (Facade)**: The main entry point that orchestrates all tool-related operations.
2. **Tool Registry**: Manages the registration and lookup of tools.
3. **Repository**: Provides data access operations for tools and executions.
4. **Security Scanner**: Validates tools and execution parameters against security policies.

### Specialized Components

1. **Discovery Service**: Discovers tools from various sources.
   - **Strategy Factory**: Creates strategies for different discovery sources.
   - **Discovery Strategies**: Implements source-specific discovery logic.

2. **Evaluation Service**: Evaluates tools against various criteria.
   - **Security Evaluator**: Evaluates security aspects of tools.
   - **Performance Evaluator**: Evaluates performance characteristics.
   - **Compatibility Evaluator**: Evaluates compatibility with different environments.
   - **Usability Evaluator**: Evaluates usability and documentation quality.

3. **Integration Service**: Integrates tools with agents.
   - **Adapter Factory**: Creates adapters for different tool types.
   - **Integration Adapters**: Implements type-specific integration logic.
   - **Parameter Validator**: Validates execution parameters against schemas.

## Class Hierarchy and Relationships

The service uses polymorphism and factories extensively to enable extensibility:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for tool discovery strategies
- **Adapter Pattern**: Used for tool integration adapters
- **Factory Pattern**: Used to create strategies and adapters
- **Facade Pattern**: Used to simplify the API

## Interfaces

The service exposes the following APIs:

1. **Tool Management**:
   - Register, update, delete tools
   - List and search tools

2. **Tool Discovery**:
   - Discover tools from various sources
   - Register discovered tools

3. **Tool Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate tools against security, performance, compatibility criteria
   - Get evaluation results

4. **Tool Integration**:
   - Integrate tools with agents
   - Update and remove integrations

5. **Tool Execution**:
   - Execute tools with parameters
   - Get execution results and logs

## Security

Security is a primary concern for the Tool Integration Service:

- **Security Scanning**: All tools are scanned for security issues before registration
- **Parameter Validation**: Execution parameters are validated against schemas
- **Execution Sandboxing**: Tools are executed in a sandbox for isolation
- **Permission Management**: Tools require specific permissions to perform sensitive operations

## Extension Points

The service is designed to be extensible:

1. **Discovery Strategies**: Add new strategies for discovering tools from different sources
2. **Integration Adapters**: Add new adapters for integrating different types of tools
3. **Evaluation Criteria**: Add new criteria for evaluating tools
4. **Security Policies**: Configure security policies for tool validation

## Configuration

The service is configured through environment variables:

- Database connections
- Security policies
- Execution limits
- MCP server configuration

## Dependencies

The main dependencies are:

- FastAPI for the API layer
- SQLAlchemy for database access
- Redis for the event bus
- JsonSchema for schema validation
- Aiohttp for async HTTP requests
