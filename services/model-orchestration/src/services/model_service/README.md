# Model Service Package

This package contains the implementation of the Model Service, which is responsible for managing models and processing model requests in the Model Orchestration service.

## Structure

The Model Service has been modularized to improve maintainability and readability:

- `__init__.py`: Package initialization and exports
- `model_service.py`: Main ModelService class that combines the functionality from the mixins
- `model_management.py`: ModelManagementMixin for model CRUD operations
- `request_processing.py`: RequestProcessingMixin for processing different types of model requests
- `logging.py`: LoggingMixin for request logging and performance tracking

## Design Pattern

The Model Service uses the **Mixin** design pattern to separate concerns while maintaining a cohesive API. Each mixin provides a specific set of functionality:

1. **ModelManagementMixin**: Handles model registration, retrieval, updates, and deletion
2. **RequestProcessingMixin**: Processes different types of model requests (chat, completion, embedding, etc.)
3. **LoggingMixin**: Provides logging and performance tracking functionality

The main `ModelService` class inherits from these mixins to combine their functionality.

## Usage

The Model Service is used by the Model Orchestration service to manage models and process requests. It is typically instantiated in the service's dependency injection system:

```python
from services.model_service import ModelService

# In dependencies.py or similar
async def get_model_service(
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    event_bus: EventBus = Depends(get_event_bus),
    command_bus: CommandBus = Depends(get_command_bus),
    provider_factory: ProviderFactory = Depends(get_provider_factory),
    performance_tracker: Optional[PerformanceTracker] = Depends(get_performance_tracker),
) -> ModelService:
    return ModelService(
        db=db,
        event_bus=event_bus,
        command_bus=command_bus,
        settings=config,
        provider_factory=provider_factory,
        performance_tracker=performance_tracker,
    )
```

## Extending

To extend the Model Service with new functionality:

1. Add new methods to the appropriate mixin based on the functionality's concern
2. For entirely new concerns, create a new mixin and add it to the ModelService class inheritance

## Maintenance

When maintaining the Model Service:

- Keep related functionality in the appropriate mixin
- Ensure that mixins remain focused on a single concern
- Update the main ModelService class if new mixins are added
